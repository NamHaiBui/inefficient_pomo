# Questionable Pomodoro

## Inspiration

The amount of time that I watch a 10-hour loop of My Deer Friend opening and how efficient I was working while doing so, and also Data Structure and Algorithms.

## What it does

## How I built it

Blood, sweat, and tears, and Next.js with some help from LLMs.

## Challenges I ran into

Coping with the decisions that led me here.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of

- Relearning Next.js, implemented some DS & Algorithm into the application

- Coming up with the idea

## What I learned

How to integrate concepts that I have known into reality, planning, and making accommodation.

## What's next for Questionable Pomodoro

- Make it more interactive, allow users to add in their own video.
- Integrate proper safeguarding and an active LLM assistant in the application so users can work more efficiently straight out of the app.
- Caching
- User authentication
- No use cost
